# Customer Segmentation & Revenue Growth Strategy using Advanced Analytics

## Overview

This project provides an end-to-end Data Science solution for understanding customer behavior, identifying high-value segments, and recommending revenue-focused business strategies. It integrates deep EDA, statistical analysis, clustering, RFM, cohort analysis, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) modeling to deliver insights used in e-commerce, retail, SaaS, telecom, and banking domains.

## Project Workflow

```
Raw Data → Cleaning → EDA → Statistical Tests → Feature Engineering
→ Clustering → Segmentation → RFM → Cohort Analysis → CLV → Insights
```

## Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to understand who their most valuable customers are, why users churn, and which segments respond to marketing efforts. This project solves that by analyzing customer and transaction data to create meaningful segments and actionable revenue strategies.

## Key Components

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

* Missing/outlier analysis
* Distribution & density plots
* Correlation maps
* Customer journey understanding

### 2. Statistical Analysis

* T-tests, ANOVA, Chi-square
* Hypothesis validation
* Statistical significance & confidence intervals

### 3. Feature Engineering

* Purchase frequency
* Recency metrics
* Monetary scores
* Discount sensitivity
* Seasonality and reorder patterns

### 4. Customer Segmentation

* K-Means
* Hierarchical clustering
* DBSCAN
* Gaussian Mixtures
* Cluster evaluation using silhouette and DB-index

### 5. RFM Analysis

Generates segments such as:

* Champions
* Loyal Customers
* At-Risk Customers
* About-to-Churn
* New Customers
* Price-Sensitive

### 6. Cohort Analysis

* Retention patterns
* Monthly/weekly cohorts
* Repeat purchase behavior
* Churn progression

### 7. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Models used:

* BG/NBD
* Pareto/NBD
* Gamma-Gamma
  Predicts long-term customer revenue and expected repeat purchases.

## Deliverables

* Jupyter Notebook
* Segmentation visualizations
* RFM tables
* Cohort heatmaps
* CLV predictions
* Executive summary report
* Dashboard (Tableau/Power BI/Plotly)

## Skills Demonstrated

* **Technical:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Lifetimes
* **Statistical:** Hypothesis testing, distributions, inference
* **Business:** Segmentation strategy, retention analysis, revenue optimization

## Why This Project Stands Out

This project showcases real business thinking, statistical depth, customer analytics expertise, and the ability to convert raw data into concrete revenue strategies—making it an industry-grade Data Science portfolio project.
